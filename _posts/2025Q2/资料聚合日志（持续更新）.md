Free Live Python Sessions for my Udemy Students

Exciting developments in AI are changing the world of programming! I've received lots of requests to help students explore the potential of LLMs (Large Language Models) through my Udemy courses on OpenAI, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude 3 APIs, LangChain and more.

  

To ensure you gain the most from these courses, a basic understanding of Python is key. That's why I'm offering a series of FREE, live Python sessions specifically designed to support Python beginners.

  

  

  

If you're a Udemy student of mine and want to dive into AI with Python, please fill out this short Google form to help me plan the sessions: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TjBYQiCsLJzaZypVh73_3iXHOC0Coe2Cjbj_bUpneFU/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TjBYQiCsLJzaZypVh73_3iXHOC0Coe2Cjbj_bUpneFU/edit)

  

  

  

Bonus: Check out my brand new YouTube video on Anthropic's Claude 3 API with Python: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxhrGyZJPPY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxhrGyZJPPY)

  

Claude 3 is now ranked the first LLM in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard.

An update, a new video and a super tutorial on LLMs

Hi,

  

I've got an update for you!

  

As you already know, I strive to keep all my courses updated and to add new content regularly.

  

Following the significant update to the latest OpenAI API, I've just added a new video (Lecture #34) about the text-to-speech API, which grants us the ability to generate natural-sounding audio from written text, transforming our written content into an auditory experience.

  

  

  

I'm also thrilled to share with you an exceptional talk on LLMs: [1hr Talk] Intro to Large Language Models by Andrej Karpathy, one of the most prominent figures in the AI landscape.

  

  

  

Happy learning!

  

Andrei
