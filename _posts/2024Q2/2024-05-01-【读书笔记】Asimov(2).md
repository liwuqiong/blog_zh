Infant Prodigy

- I supposed that if I had had ... and if ..., he might have .... I can only thank whatever chance has guided my life that this was not so.
- My father, however, was a small storekeeper, with no knowledge of American culture, with no time guide me in any way, and no ability to do so even if he had the time. 
- In other words, circumstances conspired to allow me to find my own happy level. 
- ... I learned to read with a minimum of outside help. 
- ... the learning was on my initiative.
- I did not realize that my memory was remarkable until I noticed that my classmates didn't have memories like it.
- For things that do interest me, and they are many, I have virtually instant recall.
