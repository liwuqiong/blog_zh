【读书笔记】Asimov(1)

Infant Prodigy

- I have been an American by surroundings since I was three years old. ... I am completely and entirely American by upbringing and feeling.
- I remember virtually nothing of my early years in Russia.
- egotistical... vain ... conceited... an ego the size of the Empire State Building
- I admit them freely, but no one seems to notice that.
- In any case, when I say something that sounds “vain”, I assure you it is true and I refuse to accept the accusation of vanity until somebody can prove that something I say that sounds vain is not true.
