# WQC

- 第一次的餐桌对话。
- 集中凸显了养尊处优的贵族们的日常生活；对Daisy和Tom的语言、语气、身体姿态的细节描写，多次用到跟“强迫”有关的词汇，以及随意打断人讲话，突然转换话题...
- 抓住了人物特点，即这些人已经在骨子里习惯于对其他人颐指气使、指指点点、不容置疑，让他人听命与自己，只能自己占主导，他人只能跟从... 仿佛一切都是默认的理所当然。

# Notes

- Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively undermine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.
- Slenderly, languidly, ...
- four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.
- "Why CANDLES?" objected Daisy, frowning. 
- ..., sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.
- Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresseds and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire.
- It was sharply different from the West where a n evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.
- I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way.
- infinitesimal hesitation
- she whispered enthusiastically
- For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened -- then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.
