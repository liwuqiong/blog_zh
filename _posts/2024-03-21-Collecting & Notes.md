# The Great Gatsby
Francis Scott Fitzgerald

## Chapter 1
- younger and more vulnerable years
- turning over in my mind ever since
- Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.
- veteran bores

%% 作者性格(作者认为是the abnomal mind)受到父亲影响，不轻易评判他人(reserving judgements)，对他人保持了开放心态和好奇心，也因此才跟其他人不一样，对后面的Gatsby做出了不一样的描述。 %%

- it came about that... 
- be privy to... 
- most of the confidences were unsought -- frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering o the horizon.
- ... a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth.
%% 实际上已经点出了为什么要reserving judgements: 人们出生并非平等，一些东西（如所谓的“体面”）在出生时就已经分配好。记住这一点，不去评判他人，让作者能知道很多他人的隐秘信息，成为一个好的倾诉对象，正因为如此，作者才成了后面盖茨比与上流社会的一个沟通桥梁。 %%
